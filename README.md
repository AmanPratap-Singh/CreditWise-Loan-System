# 💳 CreditWise Loan System

An Intelligent Loan Approval Prediction System built using Machine Learning to help financial institutions make fast, accurate, and unbiased loan approval decisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

SecureTrust Bank processes hundreds of loan applications daily across urban and rural India.

The traditional **manual verification process** leads to:

* ❌ Rejection of eligible customers
* ❌ Approval of high-risk customers
* ❌ Time-consuming & biased decisions

To solve this, we developed an **AI-powered Loan Approval Prediction System** that predicts whether a loan application should be **Approved (1)** or **Rejected (0)** before final human verification.
